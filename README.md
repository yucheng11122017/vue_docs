## Contributing

This site is built with [MarkBind](https://markbind.org/). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `docs`. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as optional chaining.

## Working on the content

- This site was derived from the [original Vue documentation](https://github.com/vuejs/docs).
- See MarkBind user guide [here](https://markbind.org/userGuide/).
